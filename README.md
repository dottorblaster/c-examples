# C Examples

Some C exercises related to (but not only) my OSes exam.

These are essentially split in two subdirs:

- _my-own_: own stuff, like reimplementations of nice things
- _tlpi_: exercises taken from The Linux Programming Interface

## Special note
This is **not** to be intended as software to be run once more than the minimum checks needed for it to be ok-this-sorta-works. These are exercises that I did to study syscalls and their behaviour, none of these is to be intended as code of mine as a work of art or as standard quality of my job.

I can prove you that I am a much better Javascripter/Gopher/Pythonista.
